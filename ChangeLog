	0.77 CPAN release

2004-04-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm (DialogBox): support -popover, cursor by default.
	(ROText): proper implementation that is read-only to the user.
	(DialogBox): don't use [list] to set button command value, as then
	it will be returned as a list.  Instead use [] around the command,
	which correctly listifies things.

2004-04-16  Gisle Aas  <gisle@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Cleanup.  Use Getopt::Long instead of handcoded
	option parsing. Integrate ceMakefile.PL.

	any more.
	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: Enable XS version check during bootstrap.

2004-04-14  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm (need_tk): remove tiny obsolete piece

2004-04-14  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: Optionmenu now imlpemented using tk_optionMenu
	removed Tix, itk implementations of Optionmenu.
	Tcl::Tk::Widget::MultipleWidget understands a bit more options.
	* t/optmenu.t: passed most test, yet there are incompatibilities.

2004-04-13  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: Optionmenu further imlpementation (although
	not complete; there are two implementations: using Tix and Itk)
	(need_tk): now recursively used.
	Tcl::Tk::Widget::MultipleWidget understands a bit more options.

	special_widget_abilities (requires very recent Tix).

2004-04-12  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>
	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: Optionmenu very first steps
	changed few $int->call(...); to $int->icall(...);

2004-04-12  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>
	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: removed package Tcl::Tk::Widget::Scrolled
	Renamed sub Scrolled to Scrolled0, Scrolled now uses
	Tcl::Tk::Widget::MultipleWidget, yet it has more implemented
	methods now.

2004-04-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm (Tree): recognize addchild, anchor, column and
	delete submethods.
	(new): Call to CreateMainWindow no longer needed.

	* Makefile.PL: add the ability to control what tclsh we build with
	by passing --tclsh (unused, paired to Tcl's Makefile.PL),
	--tclconfig (path to tclConfig.sh to get data from),
	--tkconfig (path to tkConfig.sh to get data from) and
	--buildspec (use BUILD spec info in conjunction with --*config).

	* Tk.xs (CreateMainWindow): delete unused (pre-Tk8) code.  This is
	now just a shell function for those that may still call it.

2004-04-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm (new): set Tk::VERSION for pTk compatability.
	(AUTOLOAD): Raise main DEBUG prints to level 2, add level 1 DEBUG
	prints keyed to each type of method created.
	Reorder the AUTOLOAD precedence, moving wm/winfo methods after the
	ptk2tcltk_mapper and special_widget_abilities checks.  Add 'pack'
	to the camelCase sub recognition.
	Significantly increase AUTOLOAD usage by making geometry,
	protocol, title, reqwidth, reqheight, screenwidth, screenheight,
	height, width, rgb, children, packPropagate, fontNames, idletasks,
	font, waitVariable AUTOLOADED.
	Add resizable, deiconify, iconify, group, maxsize, stackorder,
	state, transient and widthraw to 'wm' method AUTOLOADs.
	(DialogBox): add pTk compat sub (not completed)

2004-04-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm (Scrolled): call ScrolledWindow instead of
	replicating code to do the same.
	(create_ptk_widget_sub): compress ptk2tcltk mapping by using an
	array of [widget, wprefix, ?package?].
	(need_tk): simplify with fallback to package require.

2004-04-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	Added some more widgets to recognize.

2004-04-05  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm corrected typo in comment about Tree widget
	(_process_underline): now it takes ref to hash and edits it
	to save array copies.

	Tcl::Tk::Widget::MultipleWidget now started working (to ease
	perlTk compatibility)

	Version 0.76 for releasing to CPAN

	* META.yml remove DOS line endings, Tk.pm=>lib/Tcl/Tk.pm

	(w_uniq): more debugging info.
	(getOpenFile, getSaveFile): add as pTk compat functions
	(AUTOLOAD): handle after[A-Z]* commands as pTk compat funcs.

2004-04-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	configure the toplevel menu when created.
	(Tree): add compat routine for pTk Tree
	(Scrolled): Tree does its own scrolling (other widgets may too)

2004-03-31  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* lib/Tcl/Tk.pm: add BEGIN usage comments for DEBUG and cleaned up
	usage.
	(need_tk): prefer call over Eval and destroy dummy widgets.

2004-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* t/Tk.xbm, t/Xcamel.gif, t/folder.xpm, t/photo.t, t/zzPhoto.t:
	* META.yml: added files for 0.75 that weren't in CVS

2004-03-28  Vadim Konovalov  <vkonovalov@peterstar.ru>

	released version 0.75 to CPAN

	DEBUG now off by default
	
	Added file Meta.yml (but CPAN indexer reports syntax error)
	Must correct this according to CPAN specs
	(http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-new.html)

	README more explanations and better structured

	More perlTk compatibility:
	  * Listbox/perlTk => listbox
	  * Tcl::Tk::Exists (Tk::Exists)
	  * 'Darken' widget method (borrowed from Widget.pm/perlTk)
	  * 'timer' behaves like widget
	  * replaced options now could be subroutine ref
	  * canvas bind
	  * Photo
	  * Menu, Menubutton much more capable now
	  * few others (wm, winfo, ...)

2004-03-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Tk.pm: correct pannedwindow -> panedwindow
	Add hijacking of Tk::* modules on @INC path to detect when Tk is
	being loaded after we have been.  At some point this either needs
	to be disallowed or (better yet) the modules must be emulated
	using Tcl::Tk.

	started using ChangeLog
