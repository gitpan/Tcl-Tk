	released version 0.75 to CPAN

	DEBUG now off by default
	
	Added file Meta.yml (but CPAN indexer reports syntax error)
	Must correct this according to CPAN specs
	(http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-new.html)

	README more explanations and better structured

	More perlTk compatibility:
	  * Listbox/perlTk => listbox
	  * Tcl::Tk::Exists (Tk::Exists)
	  * 'Darken' widget method (borrowed from Widget.pm/perlTk)
	  * 'timer' behaves like widget
	  * replaced options now could be subroutine ref
	  * canvas bind
	  * Photo
	  * Menu, Menubutton much more capable now
	  * few others (wm, winfo, ...)

2004-03-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Tk.pm: correct pannedwindow -> panedwindow
	Add hijacking of Tk::* modules on @INC path to detect when Tk is
	being loaded after we have been.  At some point this either needs
	to be disallowed or (better yet) the modules must be emulated
	using Tcl::Tk.

	started using ChangeLog
